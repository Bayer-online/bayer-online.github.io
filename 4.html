Sounds like you are talking about something important.<br/> <br/> sign up - Informal. Sounds like something casual.<br/> <br/> 1. Is it correct to use "enroll" or "sign up" when you talk about college?<br/> <br/> I'd say 'enroll', because college is important. <br/> <br/> But where I live, you have to apply to a college, and wait until they accept you. So 'apply' is a more common term than 'enroll'.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> For exampe:<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> You enroll <b> in </b> <i> something.</i> <br/> <br/> I want te enroll to (for?) (a? the?) college.<br/> <br/> I want to sign up for (to?) (a? the?) college.<br/> <br/> Say 'college' with no article, or else use the name of a particular college.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm not sure about the articles as well.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> 2. Is it correct to use "enroll" or "sign up" when you talk about the gym?<br/> <br/> 'Enroll' is too formal. Say 'sign-up' or 'join'. I usually hear 'join'.<br/> <br/> For example:<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I want to enroll to the gym.<br/> <br/> I want to sign up (to?<b> for</b> ?) the gym. Perhaps <b> 'at'</b> is more common.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Or is "join the gym" the only possible solution?<br/> <br/> Best wishes, Clive<br/> <br/> <span> Jul 16 2009 13:16:04 </span> <b> <span> Clive</span> </b> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> add a comment Thanks.<br/> <br/> Is<br/> "I want to enroll in college" correct then?<br/> <br/> Longman dictionary says:<br/> <br/> "enroll for/on - British English<br/> I decided to enrol for 'Art for Beginners'."<br/> <br/> Does it mean that enroll for/on is correct only in British English? <br/> <br/> Thanks. <span> Jul 16 2009 17:00:56 </span> <b> <span> anonymous</span> </b> add a comment <i> </i> Students: Are you brave enough to let our tutors analyse your pronunciation ?
