These are renewed annually on your anniversary date for the duration of active enrollment. <br/> **Lit&rsquo;l Duke and Golden Rule Preschool require an additional $45 application fee. <br/> <b> Billing and Payment</b> We operate on a perpetual enrollment basis. Your child&rsquo;s spot in class is automatically reserved upon timely receipt of your monthly tuition payment. Tuition is billed every four (4) weeks. Please make sure that we have your preferred email address. All tuition billing at Golden Triangle Gym is set up as automatic billing. Upon registering for a class, you will be asked to provide bank account information for a monthly electronic draft-withdrawal, or debit/credit card information for automatic account billing. Your payment will be automatically charged the last Tuesday of the current for the upcoming month. <br/> <b> Multi-Class Discount</b> For families with multiple students or a student enrolled in multiple classes in any of our programs, we offer a flat $5 discount off their monthly tuition for each additional student and/or class. This discount does not apply to competitive team tuitions or Lit&rsquo;l Duke/Golden Rule preschool. <br/> <b> Makeup Policy</b> Because of our low student to teacher ratio, we are unable to prorate or refund missed classes but we do offer make-up tokens. <br/> <b> To Un-Enroll</b> To aid in instructor scheduling, prevent an incorrect tuition charge or unnecessary auto-draft, please notify our office. While a verbal message is appreciated, written notice via email is preferred (2 weeks notice is helpful). <span> If a student stops coming to class without notification then that student's account will be charged for the additional 30 days. This charge will be for holding the student's place in that class instead of offering that place to one of the many on a waiting list. For families choosing to un-enroll in the middle of the month, an account credit will be offered.</span> <span> <br/> </span> <span> <b> What To Wear</b> </span> <span> Students may wear tucked in T-shirts and active wear pants/shorts/leggings or leotards. Hair should be pulled neatly and securely away from the face. No chewing gum, dangling jewelry, large bows or hair ornaments. Students will be barefoot or have activity-appropriate footwear during class. Personal items should be left in our coat room area. Be sure your student's personal items are marked with their name. </span> <b> <span> We are not responsible for any lost or stolen items.</span> </b> <span> <br/> </span> <span> <b> Arrival &amp; Pickup</b> </span> <span> Be sure your student arrives 5-10 minutes before his/her scheduled class time, but no earlier. Please inform us if you know you will be late picking up your student. During peak times the parking lot is crowded so please instruct your student to wait inside the gym until you arrive. Please take into consideration that our students may include young children so please drive slowly and carefully. </span> <h3> Questions?
