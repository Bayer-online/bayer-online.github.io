Instead, decide how many days of the week you can realistically make it to the gym and start there. You can always increase the frequency of your workouts later on when going to the gym becomes more of a habit. [1] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> If you're new to working out, try setting aside 2 days a week to go to the gym. That way, you can get your feet wet without feeling overwhelmed. You could also try going to the gym every other day of the week so that you have a day off in between your gym sessions. If you think you'd have a hard time going to the gym on the weekends, you could go every day after work or school and then take the weekends off. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/a\/a0\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-2-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/a\/a0\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\/aid43367-v4-728px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-2-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Wear comfortable clothes and supportive athletic shoes to the gym.</b> You want to wear clothes that will make your workout easier and that won't get in your way while you're exercising. Go with shirts that will wick away sweat and shorts that don't restrict your range of motion. [2] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Shirts and shorts made out of polyester, spandex, nylon, or a cotton-polyester blend are good choices for the gym. [3] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Polyester, in particular, needs to be laundered after every time you sweat in it. Unwashed polyester can quickly develop an unpleasant smell. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/4\/43\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-3-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/4\/43\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\/aid43367-v4-728px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-3-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 3 <b> Bring a water bottle with you to stay hydrated during your workouts.</b> Working out at the gym makes you sweat and lose water, so it's important that you're replenishing your body as you exercise. Aim to drink 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water every 15 minutes during your workouts. [4] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Dehydration can actually negatively affect your workouts by causing cramps and dizziness, as well as making your muscles weaker. If you're going to be working out for longer than 1 hour, it's a good idea to bring a sports drink with you too so you can refuel your body. However, not all sports drinks are the same. Look for an isotonic sports drink that contains carbohydrates and sodium, which will give your body more energy during your workout. [5] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/8\/8c\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-4-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/8\/8c\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\/aid43367-v4-728px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-4-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 4 <b> Warm up for 5-10 minutes before your workouts so you don't injure yourself.</b> Make it a habit to do your warm-ups right when you get to the gym. Focus on doing active, dynamic movements that bring your muscles through their full range of motion, like leg swings, high knees , and arm circles. A dynamic warm-up will get your body ready for your workout session. [6] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Not warming up before exercising can leave your body more prone to injury, so make sure you don't skip your warm-ups at the gym. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/5\/5f\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-5-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/5\/5f\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\/aid43367-v4-728px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-5-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 5 <b> Do both cardio and strength-training exercises.</b> Try not to limit yourself to just one kind of exercise. Instead, take advantage of the weight machines, cardio machines, and free weights so you're getting a balanced workout. With cardio and strength-training exercises, you'll be burning calories and also toning your muscles and transforming your body . [7] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate cardio a week. For strength training, try to get at least 2 workouts comprised of 20 minutes of resistance training each week. You don't need to do cardio and strength training on the same day. Instead, you could spend one workout doing cardio and then your next one doing strength-training. While a balanced workout will help you get fit in the gym, you can adjust what exercises you're doing more of depending on your personal fitness goals. For example, if your goal is to build more muscle, you could spend most of your time doing strength-training exercises. Or, if you're trying to lose weight, you could focus more on cardio exercises. The right ratio of cardio to strength-training exercises will depend on your personal fitness goals, your weight, and the type of exercises you're doing. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/0\/0a\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-6-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/0\/0a\/Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\/aid43367-v4-728px-Get-Fit-in-the-Gym-Step-6-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 6 <b> Have a post-workout snack after the gym to replenish your body.</b> Choose a healthy snack with carbs to restore your body's energy, and protein to help build your muscles. If you're trying to lose weight, have a low-calorie snack that's between 150-200 calories. [8] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> For example, you could have a banana and some almond butter or a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt with some honey and fruit as a snack after the gym. [9] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> You could also make a fruit smoothie with some protein powder .

Sometimes, doing an exercise perfectly with lighter weight can be harder and give better results than using heavy weights with bad form! If you use heavy weight too soon, your body will find ways to "cheat" and you will learn bad habits, see slower results, and might even hurt yourself. If possible, ask a trainer or someone knowledgeable in the gym to watch and correct your form with light weights. Then, you can gradually add more weight as long as your form stays good. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 7</span> Helpful <span> 45</span> Question Should you do cardio or weights first? wikiHow Staff Editor <br> Staff Answer This answer was written by one of our trained team of researchers who validated it for accuracy and comprehensiveness. wikiHow Staff Editor Staff Answer If you're planning a tough workout session that involves both cardio and weight-training, do the weights first. Cardio can drain you of the extra energy that you could use to perform better with weights. Make sure you warm up well and push it hard with your weight training. Then, finish up with some good cardio work like running or a HIIT workout. Doing cardio first can fatigue your muscles and could potentially make it easier for you to injure yourself if you perform weight training after. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 0</span> Helpful <span> 0</span> Question Can I workout every day? wikiHow Staff Editor <br> Staff Answer This answer was written by one of our trained team of researchers who validated it for accuracy and comprehensiveness. wikiHow Staff Editor Staff Answer An important part of working out is giving your body the time it needs to rest and recover, but there are different ways you can do that. One way is to structure a fitness program that works different parts of your body on different days so you don't overfatigue, injure, or overtrain your muscles. For instance, you could do a leg workout on Monday, a chest workout on Tuesday, a shoulder workout on Wednesday, and so on. You could also choose to rest 1 day out of the week, or use your "rest" days to do low-impact exercises like swimming, jogging, or cycling. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 0</span> Helpful <span> 0</span> Question How long does it take to get fit at the gym? wikiHow Staff Editor <br> Staff Answer This answer was written by one of our trained team of researchers who validated it for accuracy and comprehensiveness. wikiHow Staff Editor Staff Answer The good news is, you're never that far away from getting fitter and healthier. With a committed workout schedule or program, you can make noticeable changes within 6-8 weeks. In 3-4 months of committed exercise, you can make some serious changes and will develop the discipline it takes to stay committed to your changes. Remember, fitness isn't just a part-time hobby but a lifestyle change that is ongoing. Even if it feels hard at first, eventually, you'll feel stronger, healthier, and more confident, which will make you want to keep at it and setting new goals. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 0</span> Helpful <span> 0</span> Question My gym is too crowded to enjoy it. What can I do? wikiHow Staff Editor <br> Staff Answer This answer was written by one of our trained team of researchers who validated it for accuracy and comprehensiveness. wikiHow Staff Editor Staff Answer Consider changing the time you visit the gym if possible. There are slow times at the gym, such as mid afternoons or later at night. Try asking the gym management when it's least busy. Or, look for an alternative gym that has more space or isn't as well known and thus has less people. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 0</span> Helpful <span> 8</span> Question How long will it take to build a fit and toned body?

Community Answer Don't eat while actually working out -- wait until you're done. After the workout, bananas are good as they have potassium, which is good to replenish, and get a protein shake to have with it. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 9</span> Helpful <span> 64</span> Question What should I eat before the workout? Community Answer Eat carbs, because they provide the energy that will carry you through your workout. Do not eat too much of anything before a workout because you may feel full and bloated during your workout. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 4</span> Helpful <span> 29</span> See more answers Ask a Question 200 characters left Include your email address to get a message when this question is answered.

You should also wear shirts and shorts made out of comfortable materials, like nylon or polyester, which can absorb sweat and won’t restrict your movement. During your workouts, aim to drink 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes, since you need to replenish the fluids in your body and prevent your muscles becoming weaker. In order to burn calories while also toning your muscles, balance your workouts between cardio and strength training exercises, like running on a treadmill and doing push-ups. Afterwards, eat a healthy snack, like a banana, to replenish your body’s nutrients. <span> For tips from our Fitness co-author, including which exercises to do in your cardio and weight training routines, keep reading!</span> <span> </span> <span> Did this summary help you?</span> Yes No </p> In other languages <span> Italiano:</span> Mantenersi in Forma con la Palestra <span> Español:</span> hacer ejercicio en el gimnasio <span> Português:</span> Entrar em Forma com Academia <span> Nederlands:</span> Fit worden in de sportschool <span> Français:</span> s’entrainer efficacement à la salle de sport <span> 中文:</span> 如何在健身房锻炼 <span> Русский:</span> набрать хорошую физическую форму в зале <span> Bahasa Indonesia:</span> Untuk Menjadi Fit Dalam Gym <span> العربية:</span> اكتساب اللياقة البدنية في الجيم Print Send fan mail to authors Thanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 1,213,335 times. <h2> <span> Reader Success Stories</span> </h2> <p> John Tabuti</p> <p> Apr 8, 2018</p> "Simple and clear.
